# 0x08. React Redux reducer+selector

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to effectively use Redux and Normalizr in a React application. It focuses on managing application state, normalizing nested JSON data, and efficiently accessing and updating state. The project includes examples of:

- **Reducers**: Functions that handle state changes based on actions. They ensure predictable state transitions and are a core part of Redux.
- **Pure Reducers**: Emphasis on keeping reducers pure to avoid unintended side effects and ensure state consistency.
- **Immutability**: Techniques to maintain immutability within reducers to prevent direct state mutations.
- **Normalizr**: A library for normalizing nested JSON data to simplify data management and improve performance.
- **Selectors**: Functions used to extract and compute derived state from the Redux store, providing a way to query state efficiently.
