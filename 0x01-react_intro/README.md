# React intro

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to set up a basic JavaScript application using React with Webpack and Babel. React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, and Webpack is a module bundler while Babel is a JavaScript compiler. Together, they provide a powerful setup for developing modern web applications with React.

### Key Concepts Covered:
- Creating a basic React application
- Using `create-react-app` for quick project setup
- Understanding JSX syntax and its usage
- Debugging React applications using React Developer Tools
- Testing React applications using Enzyme's Shadow rendering technique
- Integrating React with Webpack & Babel for efficient module bundling and transpiling
